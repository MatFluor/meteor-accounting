It is (atm) *only* a simple accounting software, so no interaction with your bank or more advances stuff.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n#### What do you mean by protable?\r\nWhat **portable** means is that you don't need to go through some installation process, so just download the release for your OS and you're ready to go!\r\n\r\n#### Where are the files (meaning the databases)?\r\nThe Databases are per default made where your executable resides, on the same level (I might change that later on).\r\n\r\n#### Do I need Python or the other fancy stuff installed on my machine?\r\nNo, that's what portable means too - no dependencies on your side.\r\n\r\n#### Is it reliable? If I loose the data I'm screwed!\r\nmeteor-accounting works with the SQLite3 Database engine in it's background - every transaction is written into the database when you do it - so no manuel _Save_ is necessary. **But this does not mean that a backup is useless!** A backup is a reliable way to make sure your data isn't lost in case of a crash or similar events.\r\n\r\n#### A Backup sounds nice, do I need to always copy the file to my eg. USB stick by myself?\r\nAt the moment - yes. I'm working on a simple Backup mechanism, which always saves your database on a location of your choice. The location will then be visible as \"backup path\" in the program.\r\n\r\n#### Nice thing - how much does it cost?\r\nSince it's in development, it's completely free (but don't expect flawlessness). Once it's producton-ready, there might be a price on the compiled version - in one way or another. E.g. the software itself is free, but customization option will be paid. I'm not sure which model I will follow at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
